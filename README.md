# Odin Ruby Project: Bubble Sort 
# https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-bubble-sort

This is another classic intro to programming problem. This one appears to require
a nested loop in order to solve.

Description from Odin:
Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).
